                    In April 1955, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) established the European Cup,
                    however, the English league winners, Chelsea, were denied entry by the Football League's secretary,
                    Alan
                    Hardaker,
                    who believed not participating was best for English football.
                    The following season, the English league was won by Manchester United, managed by Matt Busby.
                    The Football League again denied their champions entry, but Busby and his chairman, Harold Hardman,
                    with the help of the Football Association's (FA) chairman Stanley Rous,
                    defied the league and United became the first English team to play in Europe.

                    Thain had flown the "Elizabethan"-class Airspeed Ambassador (registration G-ALZU) to Belgrade but
                    handed the controls to Rayment for the return.
                    [23] At 14:19 GMT, the control tower at Munich was told the plane was ready to take off and gave
                    clearance for take-off,
                    expiring at 14:31.[24] Rayment abandoned the take-off after Thain noticed the port boost pressure
                    gauge fluctuating as the plane reached full
                    power and the engine sounded odd while accelerating.[25] A second attempt was made three minutes
                    later, but called off 40 seconds into the attempt
                    because the engines were running on an over-rich mixture, causing them to over-accelerate, a common
                    problem for the "Elizabethan".[25] After the second
                    failure, passengers retreated to the airport lounge.[27] By then, it had started to snow heavily,
                    and it looked unlikely that the plane would be making
                    the return journey that day. Half-back Duncan Edwards sent a telegram to his landlady in Manchester,
                    reading: "All flights cancelled, flying tomorrow. Duncan.

                    Twenty people, including seven of Manchester United's players, died at the scene of the crash. The
                    21st victim was Frank Swift, a journalist and former goalkeeper
                    who played with Busby at Manchester City; he died on his way to hospital. Duncan Edwards died from
                    his injuries on 21 February at the Rechts der Isar Hospital in
                    Munich, and the final death toll reached 23 several days later when co-pilot Rayment died as a
                    result of serious
